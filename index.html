<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p><strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong> (AI) is a field that has a long history but is still constantly and actively growing and changing. it has numerous applications and huge possibilities, which continues to expand human capability beyond our imagination.</p>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>A look into Intelligence ,AI and It's (Types,Examples,Applications,Pros and cons and more).</p>
<h2>Topic</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Artificial intelligence (AI), the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings. The term is often applied to the project of developing systems endowed with human characteristic intellectual processes such as the ability to reason, to discover meaning, to generalize or to learn from past experience. Since the digital computer 's development in the 1940s, it has been shown that computers can be programmed to perform very complicated&nbsp;tasks &ndash; such as discovering proofs for complex&nbsp;mathematical theorems or to&nbsp;play&nbsp;chess &ndash; with great skill. Nevertheless, despite continuing innovations in computer processing speed and memory capacity, no programs are yet to exist&nbsp;that can match human flexibility over wider domains or tasks requiring a great deal of past&nbsp;knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">But what is intelligence?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Intelligence has many branchs</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: left;">Learning</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">Reasoning</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">Problem solving</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">Preception</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">Language&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Learning:<br /></strong></p>
<p>As applied to artificial intelligence there are a number of different forms of learning. The simplest of these is trial and error learning. For instance&nbsp;, a simple computer program to solve mate-in-one chess problems could arbitrarily try&nbsp; totally random&nbsp;moves until mate is figured.</p>
<p><strong>Reasoning:</strong></p>
<p>There has been considerable success in programming computers to draw inferences, especially deductive inferences. However, true reasoning involves more than just drawing inferences; it involves drawing inferences&nbsp;<em>relevant</em>&nbsp;to the solution of the particular task or situation. This is one of the hardest problems confronting AI.</p>
<p><strong>Problem solving:</strong></p>
<p>Problem solving, especially in artificial intelligence, can be characterized by a range of possible actions as a systematic search to reach some predefined goal or solution. Methods for problem solving divide into specific purpose and general purpose.</p>
<p><strong>Preception:</strong></p>
<p>In perception the environment is scanned through different sensory organs, whether real or artificial, and the scene is decomposed into separate objects in different spatial relationships.</p>
<p><strong>Types of Artificial Intelligence.</strong></p>
<p><strong><strong>Type 1: Reactive machines</strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><strong>Type 2: Limited memory</strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><strong>Type 3: Theory of mind&nbsp;</strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><strong>Type 4: Self-awareness&nbsp;</strong></strong></p>

<p><strong>Examples of Aritficial Intelligence.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Automation</strong>.&nbsp;When paired with AI technologies, automation tools can expand the volume and types of tasks performed. An example is robotic process automation (<a href="https://internetofthingsagenda.techtarget.com/definition/robotic-process-automation">RPA</a>), a type of software that automates repetitive, rules-based data processing tasks traditionally done by humans.</p>
<p><strong>Machine learning.</strong>&nbsp;This is the science of getting a computer to act without programming. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that, in very simple terms, can be thought of as the automation of predictive analytics.</p>
<p><strong>Robots</strong>. This engineering field focuses on the design and fabrication of robots. Robots are often used to perform tasks that are difficult for humans to perform or perform consistently. For example, robots are used to move large objects into space in assembly lines for automobile production or by NASA. Researchers also use machine learning to construct robots which can interact in social settings.</p>

<p><strong>Self-driving vehicles</strong>. Autonomous vehicles use a combination of computer vision , image recognition and deep learning to build automated driving skills while staying in a given lane and avoiding unexpected obstacles like pedestrians.</p>
<p><strong>Applications of AI.<br /></strong>AI in <strong>healthcare</strong>.&nbsp;The biggest bets are on improving patient outcomes and reducing costs. Companies are applying machine learning to make better and faster diagnoses than humans. One of the best-known healthcare technologies is IBM Watson. It understands natural language and can respond to questions asked of it. The system mines patient data and other available data sources to form a hypothesis, which it then presents with a confidence scoring schema. Other AI applications include using online virtual health assistants and chatbots to help patients and healthcare customers find medical information, schedule appointments, understand the billing process and complete other administrative processes. An array of AI technologies is also being used to predict, fight and understand pandemics such as the new corona virus pendamic<strong>.</strong></p>
<p>AI in<strong> transportation</strong>.&nbsp;In addition to AI's fundamental role in operating autonomous vehicles, AI technologies are used in transportation to manage traffic, predict flight delays, and make ocean shipping safer and more efficient.</p>
<h2><strong>Risks and barriers of AI</strong></h2>
<p>Some voices believe that Artificial Intelligence ( AI) has risks. Especially if the potential of AI is explored, and not limited to human tasks being reproduced. Authors like Stephen Hawking or Bill Gates and various researchers have voiced their concern over AI.</p>
<p>With respect to entry barriers, these would be among the most common barriers that can occur in the business environment:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data availability.&nbsp;</strong>Often,data is presented in isolation across companies or is inconsistent and of low quality, presenting a significant challenge for companies seeking to create value from AI at scale. In order to overcome this barrier, it will be vital to draw up a clear strategy from the outset so thatAI data can be extracted in organized manner.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lack of qualified professionals.&nbsp;</strong>Another obstacle that often occurs at the business level for the adoption of AI is the scarcity of profiles with skills and experience in this type of implementations. It is crucial in these cases to have professionals who have already worked on projects of the same magnitude.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>The cost and implementation time of AI projects.&nbsp;</strong>The cost of implementation, both at the time and the economic level, is a very important factor in choosing to execute this type of project. Companies that lack internal skills or are not familiar with AI systems, must value the outsourcing of both implementation and maintenance in order to obtain successful results in their project.</li>
